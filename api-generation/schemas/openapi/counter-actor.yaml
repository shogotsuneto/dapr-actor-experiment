  description: |
    Dapr Actor API specification for the CounterActor.
    
    This actor provides stateful counter operations with persistent state
    managed by Dapr's state store. Each actor instance maintains an independent
    counter value identified by the actor ID.
    
    **Actor Pattern**: This follows the Dapr actor pattern where:
    - Each actor has a unique ID within the actor type
    - Actor state is automatically persisted
    - Methods are invoked through HTTP requests to the Dapr sidecar
    
    **Generated from**: This specification serves as the contract-first definition
    for generating Go interfaces and types.

    get:
      summary: Get current counter value
      description: |
        Retrieves the current value of the counter for this actor instance.
        If the actor has never been used, returns 0 as the default value.
      operationId: getCounterValue
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ActorId'

  /{actorId}/method/increment:
    post:
      summary: Increment counter by 1
      description: |
        Increases the counter value by 1 and returns the new value.
        This operation is atomic and thread-safe within the actor instance.
      operationId: incrementCounter
      parameters:
        - $ref: '#/components/parameters/ActorId'

  /{actorId}/method/decrement:
    post:
      summary: Decrement counter by 1
      description: |
        Decreases the counter value by 1 and returns the new value.
        This operation is atomic and thread-safe within the actor instance.

  /{actorId}/method/set:
    post:
      summary: Set counter to specific value
      description: |
        Sets the counter to a specific value provided in the request body.
        This completely replaces the current counter value.
