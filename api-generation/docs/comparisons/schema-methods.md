# API Schema Definition Methods Comparison

This document compares various approaches to defining API schemas for contract-first development. Currently, only **OpenAPI 3.0** is implemented and tested in this project.

## Overview

Contract-first development requires choosing an appropriate schema definition method. Each approach has distinct advantages, tooling, and use cases.

## Comparison Matrix

| Aspect | OpenAPI 3.0 | Protocol Buffers | JSON Schema | GraphQL SDL | AsyncAPI |
|--------|-------------|------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **Primary Use Case** | REST/HTTP APIs | gRPC Services | Data Validation | GraphQL APIs | Event-Driven APIs |
| **Type Safety** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| **Performance** | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Ecosystem Maturity** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| **Go Tooling Quality** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |

## Schema Types Overview

### 1. OpenAPI 3.0 (✅ Currently Implemented)

**Best for**: REST APIs, HTTP services, public APIs

**Advantages**: Industry standard, excellent tooling, human-readable, built-in validation
**Disadvantages**: Limited to HTTP/REST, can be verbose

**Go Tools**: `oapi-codegen` (recommended)

### 2. Protocol Buffers

**Best for**: High-performance services, microservices, language-agnostic APIs

**Advantages**: Excellent performance, strong type safety, versioning support, streaming
**Disadvantages**: Binary format, requires gRPC infrastructure, steeper learning curve

### 3. JSON Schema

**Best for**: Data validation, simple type definitions, configuration schemas

**Advantages**: Simple, lightweight, JSON-native, good for configuration
**Disadvantages**: Limited to data structures, no API semantics, fewer generation options

### 4. GraphQL SDL

**Best for**: GraphQL APIs, flexible query interfaces, client-driven APIs

**Advantages**: Flexible queries, strong type system, self-documenting, excellent tooling
**Disadvantages**: GraphQL-specific, complexity for simple use cases, caching challenges

### 5. AsyncAPI

**Best for**: Event-driven APIs, message-based systems, pub/sub architectures

**Advantages**: Designed for async communication, message-oriented, supports multiple protocols
**Disadvantages**: Newer standard, limited Go ecosystem, not suitable for synchronous APIs

## Recommendations by Use Case

### For Dapr Actor APIs (Current Project)
**Recommended: OpenAPI 3.0** - Perfect fit for HTTP-based actor method invocation with excellent documentation and Go tooling.

### For High-Performance Microservices
**Recommended: Protocol Buffers + gRPC** - Superior performance, strong typing, built-in streaming.

### For Event-Driven Systems
**Recommended: AsyncAPI + Protocol Buffers** - AsyncAPI for message flow documentation, Protocol Buffers for message definitions.

### For Public APIs
**Recommended: OpenAPI 3.0** - Industry standard with best documentation tools and widest client support.

## Implementation Strategy for This Project

For our Dapr actor context, we focus on **OpenAPI 3.0** as the primary approach because:

1. **Perfect fit**: Dapr actors use HTTP method invocation
2. **Tooling maturity**: `oapi-codegen` provides excellent Go generation
3. **Documentation**: Built-in API documentation via Swagger UI
4. **Industry standard**: Widely understood and adopted
