# API Generation Tools and Templates

A minimal demo of Dapr actors application in Go, demonstrating actor state management and method invocation patterns with API-contract-first development.

> **Note**: This documentation was largely generated by AI to provide comprehensive examples and explanations.

This directory contains tools, templates, and configurations for API-contract-first development.

## Overview

This module supports generating Go code from various API schema definitions, enabling contract-first development workflows where:

1. **API contracts are defined first** using standard schema languages
2. **Code is generated** from these contracts
3. **Implementation follows the contract** rather than the reverse

## Supported Schema Types

### OpenAPI 3.0 (✅ Currently Implemented)
- **Use Case**: REST APIs, HTTP services, Dapr actor APIs
- **Generation Target**: Go interfaces, types, contract validation
- **Tools**: Custom generators based on `kin-openapi`
- **Status**: Fully implemented and tested

### Future Support
Additional schema types can be added when needed:
- **Protocol Buffers**: For gRPC services and high-performance APIs
- **JSON Schema**: For data validation and simple type definitions  
- **GraphQL SDL**: For GraphQL APIs and flexible query interfaces
- **AsyncAPI**: For event-driven APIs and messaging systems

## Directory Structure

```
api-generation/                    # API contract-first development tools
├── schemas/openapi/               # OpenAPI 3.0 specifications (source)
├── tools/                         # Generation tools and scripts
│   ├── bin/                       # Installed tool binaries

# Generated code location (outside api-generation):
../internal/generated/openapi/     # Generated code output (integration)
```

## Key Principles

### Separation of Concerns
1. **Schemas** (`schemas/`): Source of truth API contracts
2. **Tooling** (`tools/`): Generation and validation tools  
3. **Generated Code** (`../internal/generated/`): Output integrated with main project
4. **Documentation** (`docs/`): Workflows, examples, and guidance

### Tool Installation Strategy
Only currently implemented tools are installed:
- ✅ **OpenAPI tools**: Custom generators based on `kin-openapi` (actively used and tested)
- ⏳ **Other tools**: Can be added when needed
│## Quick Start

### 1. Install Tools
```bash
cd api-generation
./tools/scripts/install.sh
```

### 2. Generate Code from Schema
```bash
# Generate from OpenAPI (only currently supported format)
./tools/scripts/generate.sh openapi schemas/openapi/counter-actor.yaml

# Generated code appears in ../internal/generated/openapi/
ls ../internal/generated/openapi/
# types.go  interface.go
```

### 3. Use Generated Code in Your Application
```go
import generated "github.com/shogotsuneto/dapr-actor-experiment/internal/generated/openapi"

func (c *CounterActor) Increment(ctx context.Context) (*generated.CounterState, error) {
    // Implementation MUST match the OpenAPI contract
}
```

## Integration with Main Server

The main Dapr server (`cmd/server`) uses the contract-based CounterActor implementation with generated OpenAPI types for type safety and contract compliance.
